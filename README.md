# TicketTool

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.

This project is simple ticket tool (Jira for example).

## Command to run the project
Run `ng serve --port 4209` for the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4209/`. The Rest API used in this project are protected with the CORS settings. If you don't use port 4209, it will give you CORS error in the browser console.

### Youtube
I referred the below mentioned Youtube tutorial to develop this. This is just practice project. And not made for any production use. I am not recommending this project for any production use.
